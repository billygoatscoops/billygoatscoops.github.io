								<h1 style="text-align: center">Who are you?</h1>
								<p>Hello! I added this little section here to give not only a short introduction to myself, but also as a summarization of what to expect from this blog. My name is Ishan Taparia and I am a 24 year old living in the wonderful city of Chicago! I make my living via a relatively boring tech job but have always been enamored with food, cooking, and recipe creation within all cuisines.</p>
                                <p>I have always aspired to make a living with food but have been repeatedly told by people both in and outside the industry that it is a soul sucking and ardous endeavor, and I should just keep my love of food as a hobby. Being inspired by the countless Youtubers and social media bloggers who create food content, I looked to start some sort of page where I would post videos but was again faced with what seemed to be an insurmountable task: attempt to stand out amongst the thousands of people who can record professional looking videos better than anything I could ever make.</p>
                                <p>I finally had my eureka moment when I delved into the world of ice cream making. All cuisines of the world have avid followers and equally avid haters, but I find it to be a mostly universal fact that people just cannot resist their sweet tooth. In addition to being less saturated by content creators, I see ice cream as a blank canvas upon which any myriad of flavor profiles and toppings can be added to create something that is truly one-of-a-kind. As explained by Jeni Britton Bauer, the queen of the artisinal ice cream industry who founded <a href="https://jenis.com/">Jeni's Ice Cream</a> next to my alma mater and a huge influence for me, "It's like poetry to me. Ice cream is all about scent. You can tell stories and transport people... The flavor blooms and builds as you eat it."</p>
                                <p>After many years of wanting to also have an outlet for writing, I decided on this blog to be the perfect goal for my creative endeavours - a place where I can write about my love for food and the creation of unique recipes, and a chance to teach others and pass on my love of serving food to other people.</p>

								<h1 style="text-align: center">Why should I care?</h1>
								<p>Honestly, you really shouldn't. I work in a field that couldn't be less related to food and have absolutely no professional cooking experience of any kind. As you go through my blog you'll come to see that my picture taking skills are less than stellar, and I can often be extremely verbose and borderline sarcastic to get my point across.</p>
                                <p>However, this is still something that I am extremely passionate about, and I really do think that my recipes are unique and taste incredible. I am hoping to be able to pass on techniques and tutorials for people to prove that ice cream isn't hard to make at all and that anyone can make delicious treats at home as easily as I can.</p>
                                <p>Plus, you clicked on my site so it's technically your fault for being here ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

								<h1 style="text-align: center">Why goat milk?</h1>
                                <p>Even though ice cream was a relatively unique field to write about, I still wanted an aspect of this blog to unlike anything I've seen online. As you will learn more about in the <a href="tutorial.html">Ice Cream Making 101</a> section of this blog, one of the basic building blocks of ice cream is the type of milk being used. Typically whole milk is used as a base, it has the ideal fat content to create a creamy texture once churned. One day after walking aimlessly around Whole Foods, I happened upon a little container of goat milk and was inspired to attempt a basic vanilla ice cream using it as the base.</p> 
                                    
                                <p>The result was something that was creamier than anything I've ever made. Based off of further research like at this article <a href="https://summerhilldairy.com/blog/goat-milk-vs-cow-milk/">here</a>, I discovered that not only is goat milk fattier than cow's milk, but it has a better nutrional combination of vitamins and the lower lactose levels make it easier for the human body to digest. All these factors combined led me to picking goat milk as the "schtick" of my recipes.</p>

                            <header>
								<h1 style="text-align: center">What should I expect to read about here?</h1>
								<p>There are 2 main objectives for this blog: tutorials on ice cream making, and presenting my original recipes and how to go about creating them.</p>
                                <p>I will cover everything from the basics, to more complicated and nuanced topics like plating and flavor combinations in the hope that anyone can start reading this blog and start making ice cream for their family and friends ASAP. I will go through my brainstorming process and rationale behind picking the flavors that I pick as most of my recipes are directly inspired by personal experiences of mine.</p>
                                <p>Don't worry, I'm well aware of the hatred that people have of recipe websites that have long and unneccesary explanations of recipes before actually getting into the meat of the process. While I will unabashedly still include these paragraphs of my anecdotal life experiences in my recipe pages, I will make it very easy to skip them entirely if your goal is to just know how to make something.</p>
