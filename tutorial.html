                                <h2>What even is Ice Cream?</h2>
                                <p>As with most concepts related to the culinary arts, there are very specific and nuanced variations on dishes that are seemingly the same. I will mostly be focusing on ice cream with this blog, not frozen yogurt, or custard, or gelato, all of which are defined by their butter fat content ratios and ingredients that go into their base. <br />
                                Ice cream is categorized as having around 14-25% butterfat (gelato in comparision is around 4-9%), in addition to being comprised of air for 30-50% of it's total composition. Ice cream is offially defined as custard when it contains more than 1.4% in egg yolk, among other unimportant distinctions.</p>
                                <p>Keeping in mind that all these minute differences shouldn't matter as long as the end result just tastes damn good, I will stick to mostly ice cream for now and possibly explore other definitions of the sweet and creamy treat that we all know and love down the road.</p>

                                <h2>The Tools</h2>
                                <p>Now that we understand what ice cream actually is, let's discuss the equipment you will need to make it. I want to start this off by saying that none of the tools I am about to mention are 100% required to make ice cream. You most certainly produce the exact same results without the somewhat expensive applicances I will go over, but the process will definitely be more annoying.</p>
                                <h4>Sous Vide</h4>
                                <p>This is probably my favorite tool in my entire kitchen. A sous vide is a fancy sounding name for a device whose sole purpose is to regulate the temperature of a water bath down to the exact degree. <br /> When creating your ice cream base, one of the first steps is going to be to pasteurize the mix of egg yolks, cream and goat milk. In order to pasteurize your base succesfully it has to be held at a specific temperature for an extended amount of time, something that is incredibly easy to do with a sous vide machine. Simply set the temperature and time on the device, and it will take care of regulation for you</p>
                                <p>In order to do this without a sous vide, placing your ice cream base on a low simmer is the next easiest thing you can do. It will be very cumbersome as you will have to take care of the temperature regulation yourself, ideally with a food thermometer. Keep the temp under 155&deg;F and you risk botulism, keep the temp over 155&deg;F and you run the risk of creating very sweet and liquidy scrambled eggs</p>
                                <p>I highly recommend buying a sous vide because it serves many other purposes other than pasteurizing ice cream bases. It is an invaluable asset when it comes to cooking steaks and other difficult cuts of meat to absolute perfection, and has many uses for food prep at a larger scale if you are looking to cook food for many people at once.</p>
                                <h4>Churner</h4>
                                <p>This highly specific piece of equipment is used to churn and introduce air into your fully pasteurized ice cream base. It is comprised off a bucket that is lined with conductive liquid designed to keep the bucket as cold as possible, along with a paddle in the center to keep the ice cream constantly mixing into itself. </p>
                                <p>As with the sous vide, it is possible to make your own setup to emulate the churner but it is infinitely more annoying. This process involves 2 massive metal bowls, placed on top of each other with a layer of ice and rock salt in between. Keeping the vessel cold is your primary objective, and the rock salt mixed with the ice maintains a cool temperature for longer due to chemical reactions I don't have the knowledge or patience to explain. Churning ice cream can take up to 20-25 minutes of constant stirring and mixing so the physical strength needed to do this continuously cannot be understated.</p>

                                <h2>Step 1: The Base</h2>
                                <h4>Ingredients</h4>
                                <p>All ice cream recipes start at this basic building block: the base. The base of your ice cream will be a cold and creamy liquid that you will eventually pasterurize and churn to create something that actually resembles ice cream. A good starting point is always <a href="https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016605-the-only-ice-cream-recipe-youll-ever-need">Melissa Clark's basic ice cream recipe from the New York Times</a>, but I will also list out the ingredients you need to create a basic ice cream base:</p>
                                <ul>
								    <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
								    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
								    <li>&#8532; cup sugar</li>
                                    <li>&#8539; teaspoon salt</li>
                                    <li>6 large egg yolks</li>
								</ul>
                                <p>When looking through my recipes on this blog, you'll notice that I've made modifications to this base (most notably replacing whole milk with goat milk) but these ingredients blended together are all you need for a basic ice cream.</p>
                                <h4>Flavoring</h4>
                                <p>The flavor of an ice cream is determined by two different things: the base, and toppings. Toppings can provide accent flavors and textures, but the overall flavor profile of an ice cream is created at the base. The most simple choice here is a teaspoon of vanilla flavoring, but virtually any ingredient can go in during this step. Just know that anything you add at this stage will be the overall taste of the ice cream so be careful not to pick anything too strong or concentrated here</p>
                                <h4>Pasteurization</h4>
                                <p>After a quick blend to homogenize your mixture, the next step is to pasterurize the base. No one wants salmonella in their dessert and the large amount of raw egg yolks in the base can be a significant risk. Pour your base into a ziploc bag and use your sous vide to hold the base at 155&deg;F for 30-45 minutes. I also outlined the process to do this without a sous vide machine above.</p>

                                <h2>Step 2: The Aging</h2>
                                <p>This part of the process is super easy: just wait. After pasteruzing your base, it is extremely important to let your base chill out in the fridge (not the freezer) for at least 24 hours. Aging your base provides a couple benefits. As you'll see further down this tutorial, keeping your ingredients/tools as cold as possible is a big priority in the ice cream making process. Letting your base age gets it as cold as possible before you churn it. There is a ton of scientific research supporting the fact that fat droplets in dairy need time and low temperatures to bind with emulsifiers in egg yolks and form themselves into crystals, which makes for smoother, creamier ice cream that doesn't melt as quickly</p>
                                
                                <p>I cannot stress the importance of this step, coming from someone who was impatient and didn't wait the full 24 hours for one of my earliest attempts at ice cream. The resulting product was grainy and and rough and was very unpleasant to eat. There are many desserts that can be whipped up at a moment's notice, but ice cream is not one of them. If you ever invite your friends to come over for an ice cream party, make sure you plan in advance and start your recipe at least 48 hours prior to serving.</p>

                                <h2>Step 3: The Churn</h2>
                                <h4>Equipment</h4>
                                <p>This part of the process is really fun, as you finally get to see your liquid base transform into ice cream. If you are using a churner, or the bowl workaround I mentioned above, it is incredibly important to keep your equipment as cold as possible. An ice cream churner's walls are filled with liquid that needs time to freeze to cool the surface of the chamber, so make sure to keep all pieces of the churner (paddle included) in the freezer while your base ages.</p>
                                <p>Once everything is sufficiently cold/aged, you will want to turn on your churner and pour in the entire base as it rotates. For the first 15-20 minutes, it'll seem as if I've lied to you and your base is not any closer to resembling ice cream. Make sure to let it keep going, as it will quickly thicken up and solidify into the desired product.</p>
                                <h4>Toppings</h4>
                                <p>This point in the process is where you want to fold in your toppings. This is also another opportunity to drastically alter the flavor of your ice cream by adding fruits, nuts, and even alcohol. Make sure whatever you are putting in is small enough to not break your paddle as it spins, and as always ensure that it is as cold as possible.</p>
                                <p>After about 30 minutes of churning is when you will want to stop. A fully solidifed and dense ice cream will never fully form while in the churner, you'll need to freeze your ice cream further for that. Get the </p>
