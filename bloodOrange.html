                                <p>Before we get into it, I know that most people absolutely despise having to go through a wall of text just to get to the recipe. That is exactly what is about to happen here, so if you want to go right to the recipe make sure to click <a href="#scrolltest">here</a>.</p>
                                
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bloodorangemain1.JPG" alt="" /></span>After the start of my obsession with making ice cream, I went through a lot of trial and error to get to this recipe, my first successful attempt at making a palatable ice cream (Pro Tip: Never use corn in your ice cream base unless you want a pasty, grainy mess).</p> 
                                
                                <p>One of my earliest food related memories involved visits to Six Flags: Great America and the insane treats you could get there. Turkey legs the size of my thighs, buckets of popcorn so large I couldn't even support them and the most delectable treat of them all: Dreamsicle Popsicles.<br /> From the moment I took my first bite of that popsicle, I knew that the etheral combination of orange and vanilla was something special</p>
                                
                                <p>Orange and vanilla is pretty much as classic and simple as it gets. I figured that this combination would be a great idea to explore for some of my first attempts at ice cream, and it also happened to time up with some gifts I had gotten from a family friend that I used for this recipe. I couldn't help but add my own complications to try and make this dessert more exciting so check out the rest of this page to see an exact breakdown on the ingredients and processes used to make Candied Blood Orange and Cinnamon Honey Ice Cream</p><br /><br /><hr >

                            <section>
                                <p>Before going forward, make sure you read my writeup on Ice Cream Making 101 <a href="tutorial.html">here</a>. During the explanation of this recipe, I am going to assume that the specifics of the creation of the base and using the ice cream churner are already known. I will also assume that you have basic cooking skills like heat control (boiling vs. simmering), fermentation and the sanitation involved with it, knife skills, and other kitchen techniques as some toppings on this site can be fairly complicated.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 1: Blend/Pasteurize/Age Base</h2>
                                <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/bloodorangemain1.JPG" alt="" /></span><span class="image right"><img src="images/bloodorangemain1.JPG" alt="" /></span>The base is always going to be the first step of any ice cream recipe, so start with blending the ingredients of the base together. Be careful not to blend so long that the mixture heats up as this will result in curdled eggs.</p> 
                                
                                <p>After blending, make sure to pastuerize your base by using any of the methods described in my <a href="tutorial.html">Ice Cream Making 1010 tutorial</a>. After pasteurizing for 45 minutes, age the ice cream base by placing it in a fridge for at least 24 hours. Make sure that the base does not freeze, and that it only remains cool as any freezing during this process will render your end product rough and grainy.<br />
                                This waiting period is a perfect time to start the creation of the blood orange segments.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 2: Candy/Zest Blood Oranges</h2>
                                <p>It may not seem important, but picking the best possible fruit is a crucial step in the candying process. The goal is to ensure the juciest orange possible, in tandem with reducing the amount of pith on the fruit (Pith is the white layer under the skin/webby material covering the orange and is the bitterest part of the fruit). The way to achieve this is by picking the smallest blood oranges you can find at the store that look and feel ripe.</p>
                                <p>Once you've sliced your blood oranges into thin rounds (about a &#188;" in thickness), you will want to set up 2 pots filled with 2 cups of water and simple syrup. The orange rounds will take a 2 minute bath in the boiling water to remove bitterness, and will take a 2 minute plunge in an ice bath to stop the cooking process. From there, they should cook in the sinple syrup for around 20-40 minutes, or until the orange slices turn translucent. </p>
                                <p>As a word of caution, please keep the simple syrup at a simmer. Melted sugar is the kitchen equivalent of napalm as it gets scorching hot and will stick to whatever skin it gets splashed on. Maintain the lowest heat possible while keeping the slices moving every 10 minutes or so to ensure nothing sticks to the pot.</p>
                                <p>Once the slices are translucent, the objective will be to ensure they they last as long as possible while mixed in with the ice cream, as we do not have access to the preservatives that food processing companies have. This will involve dehydrating the candied slices, to draw out as much moisture content as possible. <br />
                                The best way to do this is with a dehydrator as it is crucial to maintain the lowest temperature possible to draw out moisture but not cook the slices further. An oven set at the lowest possible setting while constantly opening the door to ensure the temperature is low can work, but will be labor intensive as this process could take 2-3 hours. If you have a dehydrator, set it to 110&#8457; and let it go until the slices are dried out and easy to cut into quarters.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 3: Infuse Honey/Vodka</h2>
                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/bloodorangemain1.JPG" alt="" /></span><span class="image left"><img src="images/bloodorangemain1.JPG" alt="" /></span>This step is the most unnecessary one by far as the ice cream will taste great without the infused honey and vodka. As mentioned before, I like to over complicate things so I'll lay out exactly what I was able to come up with using the Flavor Bible by hvbuyb. I talk about this specific book on my <a href="helpfulLinks.html">helpful links</a> page and cannot understate how useful it is, is amongst other resources I've used. Be sure to check that page out for more resources that I will constantly add to over time</p>
                                <p>Rosemary and cinnamon are complimentary flavors to orange, so I decided to heat up some honey in a pot, and keep it on the lowest flame possible while adding rosemary and cinnamon to slowly let the flavors meld into each other. This process will take around 30-45 minutes, make sure you have an empty and sanitized squeeze bottle on hand to easily store and drizzle onto the ice cream once served.</p>
                                <p>The fig infused vodka was the aforementioned gift from a family friend, so that is why I have it listed as an optional ingredient. The process to make it is very simple but time consuming, and involved placing figs, vodka (please use something nice, I better not see any Tito's being used) and 1 whole vanilla bean in a sanitzed jar in a dark place for a week. <br />
                                After a week, it should be strained and placed in the fridge to ensure it lasts as long as possible, and can be used as an additional drizzle on top of the ice cream. While optional, I cannot understate how much the tiniest drizzle of this stuff elevates the ice cream overall, so I highly recommend this step if you have the time.</p>
                                
                                <h2>Step 4: Churn/Age Ice Cream Base</h2>
                                <p>Once you've got all your toppings ready to go and the base has been aged for at least 24 hours, you can begin the churn process. Get your ice cream churning equipment as cold as possible and churn the base until a loose soft serve is formed. During this churning, you will want to slowly incorporate the quartered and candied blood orange slices, along with the zest from the oranges.</p>
                                <p>Make sure to set it into the freezer for the secondary age to ensure a creamy, smooth, and scoopable end product that you can drizzle the honey and/or vodka on for the final serve. Be sure to keep the vodka usage to an absolute minimum, it can easily overpower the ice cream if too much is used.</p>
